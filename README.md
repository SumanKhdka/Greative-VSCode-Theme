# Greative Theme

A Visual Studio Code theme for the Greative Theme out there. The Greative means Great+ Creative work. The Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle.
